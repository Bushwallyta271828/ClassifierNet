#ClassifierNet
An algorithm to detect exoplanets via the transit method using a neural net.
The code is currently changing so fast (I'm writing the algorithm) I don't have time to update the README.
The \__doc\__ strings may or may not be sufficient to figure out how to use the code.
Check back later for a fuller version of this algorithm, along with instructions on how to use it.
